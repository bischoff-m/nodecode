# Why nodecode?

There are many use cases where the user needs to define steps to calculate the solution to
a problem. If there are not too many different possible steps, it is often helpful to
abstract from the code level and provide a visual interface for building a solution.

In node editors, each possible step is represented as a node and data flow between steps
as a connection. This makes it easier for the user to solve the problem, as he can focus
on the important aspects. It also allows users who don't have much experience with
programming to still build complex programs. For example, `nodecode` should be able to be
used as an SQL query builder, so that little prior knowledge is required to request data
from a database and process it upon receipt.

The concept of a node editor or very similar concepts have been used for a long time in
many different programs for various application areas. Some examples are

- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - 3D computer graphics tool
- [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) - 3D computer graphics game engine
- [RapidMiner](https://rapidminer.com/) - Data science platform
