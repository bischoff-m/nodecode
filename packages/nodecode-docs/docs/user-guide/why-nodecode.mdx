# Why `nodecode`?

There are many use cases where the user needs to define steps to calculate the solution to
a problem. If there are not too many different possible steps, it is helpful to abstract
from the code level and provide a visual interface for building a solution.

In node editors, each possible step is represented as a node and data flow between steps
as a connection. This makes it easier for the user to solve the problem, as he can focus
on the important aspects. It also allows users who don't have much experience with
programming to still build complex programs. For example, `nodecode` should be able to be
used as an SQL query builder, so that little prior knowledge is required to request data
from a database and process it upon receipt.

## Other Software

The concept of a node editor or similar concepts have been used in many different programs
for various application areas. Some examples are

- [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) - Flow-based development tool
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - 3D computer graphics tool
- [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) - 3D computer graphics game engine
- [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html) - Block diagram environment for model-based design
- [RapidMiner](https://rapidminer.com/) - Data science platform
- [Yahoo! Pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Pipes) - Web application for building data mashups
- [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/) - Automate the flow of data between software systems

The node editors offered in these programs are optimized for a specific application. For
example, it is possible to generate textures in Blender with the node editor or to
simulate a mathematical model in Simulink.

In contrast, `nodecode` tries to deliver an application-independent platform that provides
visual elements for a wide range of applications. The goal is to be able to work with
data, compute 3D graphics, simulate a model, all in the same program.

## Compared to Node-RED

Compared to Node-RED, `nodecode` makes a clearer separation between the frontend, which is
responsible for building node programs, and the backend, which is responsible for
executing node programs. In the future the backend should be able to execute programs via
a CLI without the frontend, so that node programs can be embedded in any other program
as subroutines.

The backend is written in Python which makes `nodecode` more suitable for data
science and scientific use cases. Also, in Node-RED, the state of every node can be viewed
by clicking it. In `nodecode`, these fields are shown directly on the node in the editor
("Blender-style" nodes).

## Setting of this project

This project is part of the [SMITH project](https://www.smith.care/) and the result of my
research assistant job at the chair
[i11 Embedded Systems](https://www.embedded.rwth-aachen.de/) at
[RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/) under the supervision of
**Simon Fonck**. It aims to simplify and automate the access and processing of data on
databases used at the chair.

For this use case, the program should provide SQL nodes that can be used to build SQL 
queries visually and `pandas` nodes that are used to process (filter, transform,
aggregate, ...) the data requested via the queries. Unfortunately, `nodecode` could not be
developed far enough within the project to make these functions usable.

## Current State: *October 2022*

Currently, the basic functions of the node editor (canvas) are done. Some basic fields are
implemented and the foundation has been laid to easily implement further fields. These
fields can be used to define nodes in the JSON format, of which some basic nodes are
implemented. The nodes can be added and removed from the canvas and can be connected to
build a program.

The node program is read from a file once the app starts and can be written to the same
file after editing using the *SAVE* button. There is also the *RUN* button and the *QUIT*
button which send commands/requests to the runtime.

The runtime (backend) is a separate program that connects to the UI (frontend) using
[socket.io](https://socket.io/). Its main function is to run programs supplied by the
frontend. To do this, every node should have a python script that implements its function
using a framework provided by the backend. I could not finish this framework in time and
only two testing nodes are implemented. However, not much is missing to make the backend
work.
